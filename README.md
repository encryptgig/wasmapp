# wasmapp
This is my experiment with wasm. This app is just a simple app which demostrate the use of WASM and Go.


# To get this app run:

`$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go get -u github.com/rajnikant12345/wasmapp`

#To Build this app just execute, on shell

`$ make all`

# and to serve it, just do:

`$ make run`

* Please change the port form 8090 to something else, if needed. *
